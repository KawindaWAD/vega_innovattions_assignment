# Important points related to Assessment
The app is built using the Clean Architecture approach and the state management is done using the BLoC package. The code follows standard coding guidelines relevant to the Flutter framework, and comments are provided wherever necessary.

## Code Quality
The code adheres to the Flutter coding standards and follows best practices for readability and maintainability. I have maintained a consistent coding style throughout the project and have ensured that the code is well-documented for future reference.

## Extensibility
The project follows the Separation of Concerns principle, which means that each component of the app is responsible for a specific task. This makes it easier to extend and modify the app without affecting the other parts of the code.

## Simplicity
I have aimed for the simplest solution that gets the job done while remaining readable, extensible, and testable. The app is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, and the UI is kept simple and clutter-free.

## Performance
The app is optimized for performance, and I have used the SliverList widget to achieve smooth scrolling and fast loading times. I have also minimized the number of network requests and optimized the app's resources to ensure that it runs smoothly on a range of devices.

## Robustness
The app is designed to handle and report errors effectively. I have used appropriate error handling techniques to ensure that the app does not crash unexpectedly and provides informative error messages to the user.

## Design Patterns and Data Structures
I have used appropriate design patterns and data structures to ensure that the app is efficient, scalable, and maintainable. I have followed the principles of Clean Architecture and used dependency injection with the Get_it package to manage the app's dependencies.

## Exception Handling
I have implemented proper exception handling throughout the app to ensure that it handles unexpected errors gracefully. I have used the try-catch block to catch and handle exceptions, and provided informative error messages to the user.

## Incomplete Features

Due to time constraints, I was unable to complete the Article search option. This feature would have allowed users to search for articles by keywords or phrases. Unfortunately, I was not able to implement this feature within the given timeframe.

Despite this, I was able to complete all other features within the assignment, including the login/signup functionality, news dashboard, view all articles, pagination, filters and news details page.

I want to be transparent about the incomplete feature to ensure that the hiring team has a clear understanding of my work on this project. I am committed to delivering high-quality work and would be happy to discuss my development process and any challenges I faced during the assignment.

Overall, I believe that this app is a great example of a well-designed and well-implemented Flutter app. I hope that you find it useful and look forward to hearing your feedback.
